# Student Portal

All your needs as a student just a click away.

Student life, often mentioned as the "seed time" of life is undoubtedly the most important time for any person to build their life. Success of a person depends on how well s/he utilizes the time. And without a doubt, student life is the best time for it. To make the life of a student a bit more easy, we made 'Student Portal', a simple yet useful app to help the student push their limit a bit more further. 

This app is bundled with 8 different modules with their own use cases starting from a simple To Do list to a wikipedia integration. And everything is tied together with simple intuitive layout for an easy workflow.

### Books
Books are the best friends of a student. But finding a good app can often be a challenging stuff. So, with the help of google books API, we implemented a book search feature to find the best book available in the market!

### YouTube
YouTube's homepage recommendations can often be a bit distracting when you are trying search for some study lectures. To not get distracted with the recommendations, search for some videos in the YouTube module and then open that on the browser.
